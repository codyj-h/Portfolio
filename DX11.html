        This was a university project to create a game engine using C++ and Directx11. I created a terrain that is generated with a height map as well as allowing for objects to be added to the scene.
        In this scene the plane model is loaded from Assimp.
       
    </p>
    <p>
        I created a sceneGraph that can manage objects that are laoded into the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
        We were provided a function for loading the heightmap however we needed to calculate the height of each vertex from the position on the height map.
